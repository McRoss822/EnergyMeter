# EnergyMeter
It is an IoT ed. program student`s course work(project).
It`s an Arduino Uno microcontroller based energy consumption meter.
Basically microcontroller measures consummed energy(in kWh) and sends it to the Back-end which is
used to display this current info on a React web-site.
Also I added ability to controll lights(loads) from website using relays:)
